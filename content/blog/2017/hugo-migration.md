I haven't been very active on here lately, but hopefully that will change in the coming months. As a part of reinvigorating my technical writing and removing barriers to writing new blog posts, I converted the generator for this site from Jekyll/Octopress to Hugo.

The conversion process was smooth and now the site is generated in much less than a second. Probably the biggest benefit is that dependency concerns to build and manage the site have dropped off a cliff.
