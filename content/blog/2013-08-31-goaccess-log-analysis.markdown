title: GoAccess for Log Analysis

An excellent log analysis tool that I picked up recently from a blog post by my colleague, [Amin Astaneh](http://www.aminastaneh.net/), is the [GoAccess](http://goaccess.prosoftcorp.com/) interactive web log analyzer. Out of the box, you can unleash GoAccess on raw or piped log data to reveal an array of interesting traffic patterns that might otherwise take some serious piping skills to crack - I covered some of these in a [recent blog post](/blog/2013/08/24/fun-with-accesslog/).
