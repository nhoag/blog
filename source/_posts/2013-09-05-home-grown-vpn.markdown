I just checked off another item on the TODO list - set up VPN. This was so simple and quick, I wish I'd done it earlier.

I basically just ran through the instructions at the following 3 links:

- [Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 12.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-12-04)
- [How To Set Up SSH Keys](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2)
- [How to Install OpenVPN Access Server on Ubuntu 12.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-openvpn-access-server-on-ubuntu-12-04)

Mostly the same instructions apply for Ubuntu 12.10 and OpenVPN 1.8.5.
