### Bio

Nathaniel's experience in web technologies spans over a decade. Starting with straight HTML, he leap-frogged from there to Drupal, and eventually to Acquia. While on the Acquia Support team, Nathaniel earned the nickname _Titanic_ for resolving a high rate of 'icebergs' - deep and complex support requests.

Nathaniel has lived in several areas of the northeast US, including Vermont, upstate New York, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. He also lived in central Arizona for two years. Nathaniel has backpacked in every area he has called home, and a few others besides.
